Examining Competitive House Races in the U.S.
https://elenacox1.github.io/Cook-Report/

As part of my master's project, I'm looking at out-of-state campaign donations to competitive House races from 2010 to 2018. To determine which races to look at, I looked at the Cook Political Report, a non-partisan organization that analyzes U.S. political campaigns. The Cook Report was founded in 1984 by Charlie Cook, a former Capitol Hill staffer, campaign consultant, pollster and political action committee staff member.

Cook ranks races on three categories: "likely," "lean" and "toss-up." "Likely" seats are not considered to be competitive, but have the potential to become so. "Lean" seats are considered competitive but one party holds the advantage. "Toss-ups" are the most competitive, with the potential to go to either party.

But before I begin gathering data for my master's project, I wanted to see how often Cook's projections were accurate.

To determine this, I looked at data from the MIT Election and Data Lab to find the winners of U.S. House races from 2010 to 2018 by district. I then compared the election results to Cook's ratings over the same time period.

Cook ratings that were "likely" Democrat, "lean" Democrat and "toss-up" Democrat were marked "accurate" if a Democrat won that district. I applied the same method for Republicans. In 2010, 2012 and 2014, Cook was correct around three-quarters of the time. In 2016, that number spiked to 86%, but in 2018, Cook was only right 55% of the time.
